| NTIA minimum elements (`ntia`) | July 2021 report | <https://www.ntia.gov/report/2021/minimum-elements-software-bill-materials-sbom> | Canonical host is ntia.gov (ntia.doc.gov survives via redirect). Superseded by the CISA 2026 Minimum Elements (below) but retained as the 2021 baseline many regulations still cite. |
| CISA 2026 Minimum Elements (`cisa-2026`) | v2.1 final, 2026-07-29 (TLP:CLEAR; CISA/NSA/FBI + 15 international agencies) | <https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/2026-minimum-elements-software-bill-materials-sbom> | "Updates and replaces" the NTIA 2021 elements (the Aug 2025 CISA draft was v2.0 of this document). 17 data fields + document-checkable practices as `SBOM-CISA2026-*`; explicit-unknown markers (NOASSERTION) satisfy the 2026 escape hatches; Author Signature / Generation Context / SBOM Version / Coverage are evidence-limited (Warning); the format-version floor (CycloneDX 1.4+ / SPDX 2.2+) is tool policy — CISA names no deprecated versions. Frequency, Distribution and Delivery, and Accommodation of Updates are organizational practices with no in-document evidence and carry no rules. Non-binding joint guidance. |
| FDA premarket cybersecurity (`fda`) | Final, 2026-02-03 — "Quality **Management** System Considerations…" | <https://www.fda.gov/media/119933/download> | Supersedes the June 2025 and Sept 2023 finals. SBOM elements (NTIA baseline + level of support + end-of-support date) unchanged. |

| BSI/G7 SBOM for AI (`bsi-ai`) | Final joint G7 guidance, 2026-05-12 | <https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/software-bill-materials-ai-minimum-elements> | Supersedes the Feb 2026 BSI draft the profile was first built against; element clusters unchanged at the level we check. |
| PCI DSS Req. 6.3.2 (`pci-dss`) | v4.0.1 (2024-06-11); Req. 6.3.2 with companion controls 6.3.1 / 11.3.1.1 | <https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/document_library/> | Required in assessments since 2025-03-31 (v4.0 retired 2024-12-31); citations target v4.0.1 only. The standard PDF is license-gated, so the 6.3.2 requirement/testing-procedure text is secondary-sourced (consistent across independent sources). PCI DSS prescribes no SBOM format or field schema — no format gate; the SBOM-as-inventory mapping is guidance-derived, so a passing run evidences that the inventory exists and is usable, **not** PCI DSS compliance (interviews, inventory *use*, and the software-vs-inventory comparison are assessor work). The 365-day staleness advisory is tool policy, not standard text. |
| CISA Framing Software Component Transparency (`fsct`) | Third Edition (document date 2024-09-03, published 2024-10-15) | <https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/framing-software-component-transparency-2024> | Attribute-maturity profile: Minimum Expected → Error, Recommended Practice → Warning, Aspirational Goal → Info (Error means "fails the Minimum Expected tier" — the document is non-regulatory community guidance, distinct from the Minimum Elements line; no 4th edition exists as of 2026-07). The tier structure is asymmetric and preserved as-is; §2.3.2 Redacted Components has no rule (redaction markers are not modeled). Coverage floors (≥50% license/copyright), the ≥2-identifier-kinds threshold, the depth≥2 transitive proxy, and strict global-identifier enforcement (§2.2.2.4 only "prefers" it) are documented profile policy. SBOM Type, signature, concluded-license, and dynamic-dependency checks are evidence-gated by format (see `src/quality/compliance/fsct.rs` module docs). |

## sbomqs interoperability (`quality -o sbomqs-json`)

**Parity target: interlynk-io/sbomqs v2.0.11** (2026-07-10; all formulas below
verified against the fetched v2.0.11 sources). sbomqs is a tool, not a
standard; this view exists so its 0-10 quality scores can be compared with
this tool's output side by side. Implemented in
`src/reports/sbomqs_compat.rs`, surfaced as:

- `sbom-tools quality <sbom> -o sbomqs-json` — a report in the exact
  `sbomqs score --json` schema (`pkg/reporter/json.go` field names/types:
  `run_id`, `timestamp`, `creation_info{name,version,scoring_engine_version,`
  `vendor}`, `files[]{file_name,spec,spec_version,file_format,avg_score,`
  `num_components,creation_time,gen_tool_name,gen_tool_version,`
  `scores[]{category,feature,score,max_score,description,ignored}}`).
  `creation_info` honestly identifies **sbom-tools** — it never impersonates
  the sbomqs binary, so divergent scores cannot be mis-attributed to
  Interlynk.
- A compact "sbomqs-Comparable Scores" table appended to the plain-text
  `quality` summary (per-category 0-10 rollups plus `avg_score` and the
  sbomqs-bracket grade).

Phase 1 emits the sbomqs **legacy (v1) engine's** five default categories
(23 features). The v2 engine (8 weighted categories, `score` default since
sbomqs 2.0) and the per-standard profile scores (`ntia`, `ntia-2025`,
`bsi-v1.1/v2.0/v2.1`, …) are documented here for a later phase; note that
sbomqs v2.0.11's `ntia-2025` profile tracks the superseded CISA **2025
draft** — the successor guidance was finalized on 2026-07-29 as the **2026
Minimum Elements for a SBOM** (CISA/NSA/FBI et al.), so do not describe the
CISA elements as "not yet final".

### Not convertible from the 0-100 score

The 0-100 `quality` score and the sbomqs 0-10 score use different category
taxonomies, different weights, and different missing-data semantics (this
repo renormalizes N/A categories; sbomqs keeps ignored checks in the
`avg_score` denominator), and different grade cut lines (sbomqs `ToGrade`:
A ≥ 9.0, B ≥ 8.0, C ≥ 7.0, D ≥ 5.0, F — source-verified; the sbomqs docs
page saying "A = 8.0-10.0" is stale. This repo: A ≥ 90 … D ≥ 60).
**Dividing the 0-100 score by 10 is not an sbomqs-comparable number and the
emitter never does it** — every feature score is recomputed from the
normalized SBOM with sbomqs' own formulas (the emitter does not read
`QualityReport` at all).

### Aggregation (verbatim sbomqs semantics)

`avg_score = Σ(score of non-ignored entries) / count(ALL entries, ignored
included)` — the verbatim `scores.go AvgScore()` formula, quirk included.
Features this model cannot evaluate are emitted with `ignored: true` and a
reason in `description` — never silently dropped (that would inflate
`avg_score` via the denominator) and never fabricated as 0 or 10.

### Feature mapping (ours → sbomqs, fidelity)

| sbomqs feature (category) | Computed from | Fidelity |
|---|---|---|
| `sbom_spec` (Structural) | `DocumentMetadata.format` (both normalized formats are sbomqs-supported specs) | exact |
| `sbom_spec_version` (Structural) | `DocumentMetadata.spec_version` vs sbomqs' recognized versions (CDX 1.0-1.7; SPDX 2.1-2.3) | exact |
| `sbom_file_format` (Structural) | Serialization detected from the raw document text vs sbomqs' recognized formats (CDX json,xml; SPDX json,yaml,rdf,tag-value) | approximate (detection heuristic); **ignored + reason** when the raw text is unavailable (library callers) |
| `sbom_parsable` (Structural) | Always 10 — this pipeline only scores documents it parsed | exact, with the documented asymmetry that sbomqs can also score an unparsable file 0 |
| `comp_with_name` / `comp_with_version` (NTIA) | `Component.name` / `Component.version`, proportional `10·have/total` | exact |
| `comp_with_uniq_ids` (NTIA) | Non-empty **local id** (`identifiers.format_id`: bom-ref / SPDXID) — `compWithUniqIDCheck` semantics, NOT purl/cpe (that is the BSI variant) | exact |
| `comp_with_supplier` (NTIA) | `Component.supplier.name`; for SPDX also the author field (this model maps the SPDX originator there, mirroring sbomqs' originator fallback) | approximate |
| `sbom_creation_timestamp` (NTIA) | `DocumentMetadata.created` (epoch sentinel = missing/unparseable) | approximate (a document genuinely claiming 1970-01-01 reads as missing) |
| `sbom_authors` (NTIA) | `DocumentMetadata.creators` non-empty (sbomqs counts authors **plus** tools; `creators` carries both) | exact |
| `sbom_dependencies` (NTIA) | Binary: ≥ 1 edge from the **primary component** (verbatim `sbomWithDepedenciesCheck` — not arbitrary edges) | exact |
| `sbom_required_fields` (Semantic) | Blended doc+package formula, quirks preserved: `!docOK → 0.0`; `docOK && all pkgs → 10.0`; else `(10 + 10·have/total)/2` (5.0 for a docOK zero-component SBOM). Doc/pkg sub-checks approximated where the model keeps less than sbomqs reads (CDX `bomFormat`/dependency-refs, SPDX `downloadLocation`/verification code are not modeled) | approximate (fractional formula exact; sub-checks approximate) |
| `comp_with_licenses` / `comp_with_checksums` (Semantic) | `Component.licenses` (NOASSERTION/NONE excluded, as sbomqs does) / `Component.hashes`, proportional | exact |
| `comp_valid_licenses` (Quality) | Mean over ALL components of per-component ratios `(SPDX-listed ids / total license ids)·10`; license-less components contribute 0. v1 counts **only SPDX-list membership** (`l.Spdx()`) — `LicenseRef-*`/custom ids do NOT count | approximate (expression tokenization + `spdx` crate list vs sbomqs' embedded list; `WITH` exception ids dropped) |
| `comp_with_primary_purpose` (Quality) | `ComponentType` display string vs sbomqs' per-spec purpose lists (CDX list lacks e.g. `machine-learning-model`) | approximate (typed model defaults missing purpose to Library → over-counts) |
| `comp_with_deprecated_licenses` / `comp_with_restrictive_licenses` (Quality) | Inverted proportional `10·(total−affected)/total`; 0.0 + "no licenses found" when the SBOM has no licenses. Deprecated = SPDX-list flag; restrictive ≈ copyleft flag (sbomqs uses AboutCode "copyleft/restricted" categories) | approximate |
| `comp_with_any_vuln_lookup_id` / `comp_with_multi_vuln_lookup_id` (Quality) | `identifiers.purl` OR/AND `identifiers.cpe` | exact |
| `sbom_with_creator_and_version` (Quality) | Tool creators with a digit-bearing trailing token as version (the same heuristic sbomqs applies to SPDX tool strings); zero tools replicate sbomqs' `0/0 → NaN → 0.0` coercion | approximate |
| `sbom_with_primary_component` (Quality) | `primary_component_id` present | exact |
| `sbom_sharable` (Sharing) | Quirk-faithful 0.0: sbomqs v2.0.11's vendored SPDX list carries **no** `isFreeAnyUse` flags, so every SPDX-listed document license — including `CC0-1.0` — counts non-free and the check scores 0.0 for essentially every real document. Only AboutCode "Public Domain"-category ids absent from the SPDX list would score 10 there (not replicable without its data — disclosed in the description) | exact for practical inputs; **ignored + reason** when the raw text is unavailable |

Component enumeration parity: SPDX file/snippet components and CycloneDX
service components are excluded from every per-component denominator and
from `num_components`, because sbomqs enumerates SPDX *packages* and CDX
components only. Side effect: an SPDX package whose purpose is
SOURCE/ARCHIVE/FILE is also excluded (the typed model collapses those into
`ComponentType::File`).

Other categories of this repo's 0-100 pipeline map onto sbomqs territory
only loosely (completeness → NTIA + Semantic; identifiers → the Quality
vuln-lookup features; licenses → Semantic/Quality license features;
integrity → `comp_with_checksums`; provenance → `sbom_authors`/timestamp/
creator) — the mapping is feature-level, never score-level.
